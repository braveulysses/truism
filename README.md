Truism
======
This tool displays a random slogan/aphorism from Jenny Holzer's
[Truisms](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/holzer-truisms-t03959/text-catalogue-entry)
using OS X's notifications feature.

You could stick it in your crontab or something.

## Usage

This tool is really just a wrapper around
[terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier), so you need to
install that using ```gem```.

    [sudo] gem install terminal-notifier
    ruby truism.rb

The end
